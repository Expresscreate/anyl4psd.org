					<description><![CDATA[<p>The 2030 agenda on sustainable development is the new pact on the world’s future. Its implementation is one of the most important current, ongoing tasks. According to the pact of the world’s future, development policy is all about creating new prospects for the future and that future is digital. We will only succeed in attaining the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) by 2030 if we manage to enable all people everywhere to exploit the possibility [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>INTRODUCTION In an era of rapid globalisation, human migration has reached unprecedented levels and is a defining feature of our times. Throughout its history, Cameroon and others African countries have experienced migratory movements, both voluntary and forced, which have contributed to its contemporary demographic landscape. In many parts of the continent, communities are spread across two or three nation-States, and movement is often not limited by political boundaries. Cross-border migration in Africa is an important [&#8230;]</p>

The International Geneva Symposium organized in April 2006 by Switzerland on the question of desertification, poverty and human rights highlighted the necessity of protecting land and soil to achieve the MDGs and protect human rights.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Cameroon and many African countries have been facing gender, reproductive health and nutrition challenges for several years. The fertility rate is high in several countries such as Niger (about 7.6 children per woman). Despite partner investments and Governments’ efforts, several countries have a low rate of women and family controlling their births, a low rate of births attended by skilled health personnel and a low rate of children with nutritional advice. This result in significant [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>CONTEXT High rates of youth and women unemployment represent a wasted resource. Poor youth labor market participation limits the inputs available for urgently needed growth and makes it harder for Cameroon and others developing countries to realize the benefits of labor-intensive growth strategies. Cameroon like other African countries passes through a unique demographic “window” where the youth population is maximized before birth rates begin to fall toward a more “developed economy” pattern – their success [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>INTRODUCTION The drivers and enablers of violent extremism are multiple, complex. They defy easy analysis and our understanding of the phenomenon remains incomplete. Recent attacks such as the one conducted at Garissa University in Kenya, where 147 people, mostly students, were killed; confront us with the problematic nature of many of our common assumptions: one of the main attackers, a successful lawyer from a wealthy family was not necessarily “marginalized” or “poor”. Furthermore, while we [&#8230;]</p>
