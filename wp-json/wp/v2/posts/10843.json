The 2020 Living Planet Index shows that global populations of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish have suffered an average 68% decline in less than half a century (from 1970 to 2016). \u00a0According to the World Economic Forum Global Risks Report 2020, the top five most pressing challenges facing Africa and the world over the next decade are, for the first time, all related to the environment, and include biodiversity loss and climate change. Thus, the main cause of this dramatic decline is habitat loss and degradation, including deforestation, driven by how we as humanity produce food.<\/p><p>Our economies are embedded within nature but economics do not recognize that human health, wealth and security depend on safeguarding environmental health. Nature powers industry and enterprise but we are using up \u2018natural capital\u2019 and degrading natural systems faster than nature can replenish and restore them, exceeding Earth\u2019s overall bio capacity by 58% according to Ecological Foot printing.<\/p><p>Failure to tackle nature\u2019s decline will increase nature-related risk (desertification, pollution, erosion, overexploitation of natural resources such as forest and water), hamper prosperity and economic development, further disrupt supply chains, threaten global food security, and cost the global economy at least $479 billion a year &#8211; amounting to $10 trillion by 2050. \u00a0<\/p><p>Addressing the aforementioned challenges requires the involvement of youths and civil society. Thus, as part of its engagement for ecosystems restoration African network of Young Leaders for Peace and Sustainable Development has set the New Deal for Nature and People Coalition made up of over 500 civil society organizations committed towards the nature and human positive Vision: to stop and reverse the catastrophic loss of biodiversity, ensure good governance, human rights, peacebuilding and put nature on the path recovery for present and future generations. In 2020, African youths and civil society organizations members of the coalition drafted two regional position papers on COVID19 and pandemics and towards a strong post 2020 Global Biodiversity Framework for a green growth resumption in Africa and in the world.<\/p><p>Youth and Civil Society have a role to lead the continent and the world to transiting to custodians of natural capital, human rights, peace and development. African Network of Young Leaders for Peace and sustainable Development champions the New Deal for Nature and People and believes that there is a need of ambassadors. The present call aims at recruiting the 2021 Cohort of the New Deal for Nature and People Ambassadors.\u00a0<\/p><p><strong>Overview on the New Deal for Nature and People Ambassador<\/strong><\/p><p>Can become New Deal for Nature and People (ND4NP) Ambassadors, citizens of all countries, engaged to stop and reverse the catastrophic loss of biodiversity, ensure good governance, human rights, peacebuilding and put nature on the path recovery for present and future generations.

We understand and value that people know best how to engage with their own communities, and we encourage Ambassadors to engage with their communities in their own way.<\/p><p>We&#8217;re not looking for the strongest activists.
