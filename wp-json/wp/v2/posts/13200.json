In addition, there are a number of enabling crimes such as cybercrime, and the trade in small arms and light weapons that are supporting organized criminality throughout the region, which overlap with all illicit markets noted in complex ways.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organized crime in the region generates huge profits for all involved and there are substantial illicit interregional financial flows and illicit profits heading offshore, plus money laundering occurring on a global scale. The threat from organized crime in West Africa is substantial yet there is limited capacity amongst law enforcement to manage this complex issue. Organized crime is going underreported and undetected, but various data sources reveal the following major activities and dynamics of groups and networks active in the region, which need to be addressed strategically and through building greater partnerships amongst all law enforcement agencies in the region.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-download-the-pdf-document-to-read-the-full-report\">Download the PDF Document to read the full report.<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-file\"><object class=\"wp-block-file__embed\" data=\"https:\/\/anyl4psd.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Overview-of-Serious-and-Organised-crime-in-West-Africa_ANYL4PSD.pdf\" type=\"application\/pdf\" style=\"width:100%;height:200px\" aria-label=\"Embed of Embed of Overview-of-Serious-and-Organised-crime-in-West-Africa_ANYL4PSD..\"><\/object><a id=\"wp-block-file--media-efd3633e-6eba-4fb9-ab8e-9c2b04d7f010\" href=\"https:\/\/anyl4psd.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Overview-of-Serious-and-Organised-crime-in-West-Africa_ANYL4PSD.pdf\">Overview-of-Serious-and-Organised-crime-in-West-Africa_ANYL4PSD<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/anyl4psd.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Overview-of-Serious-and-Organised-crime-in-West-Africa_ANYL4PSD.pdf\" class=\"wp-block-file__button\" download aria-describedby=\"wp-block-file--media-efd3633e-6eba-4fb9-ab8e-9c2b04d7f010\">Download<\/a><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Transnational organized crime in West Africa is a persistent threat.
