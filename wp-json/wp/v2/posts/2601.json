These drivers include agricultural encroachment, deforestation, road construction, dam building, irrigation, wetland modification, mining, the concentration or expansion of urban environments, coastal zone degradation, and other activities. These changes in turn cause a cascade of factors that exacerbate infectious disease emergence, such as forest fragmentation, disease introduction, pollution, poverty, and human migration. The Working Group on Land Use Change and Disease Emergence grew out of a special colloquium that convened international experts in infectious diseases, ecology, and environmental health to assess the current state of knowledge and to develop recommendations for addressing these environmental health challenges. The group established a systems model approach and priority lists of infectious diseases affected by ecologic degradation. Policy-relevant levels of the model include specific health risk factors, landscape or habitat change, and institutional (economic and behavioral) levels. The group recommended creating Centers of Excellence in Ecology and Health Research and Training, based at regional universities and\/or research institutes with close links to the surrounding communities. The centers\u2019 objectives would be 3-fold:\u00a0<em>a<\/em>) to provide information to local communities about the links between environmental change and public health;\u00a0<em>b<\/em>) to facilitate fully interdisciplinary research from a variety of natural, social, and health sciences and train professionals who can conduct interdisciplinary research; and\u00a0<em>c<\/em>) to engage in science-based communication and assessment for policy making toward sustainable health and ecosystems.<\/p>\n<p id=\"__p5\" class=\"p p-first\">Human-induced land use changes are the primary drivers of a range of infectious disease outbreaks and emergence events and also modifiers of the transmission of endemic infections (<a id=\"__tag_98812689\" class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1247383\/#b43-ehp0112-001092\">Patz et al. 2000<\/a>).

The invited experts worked to establish consensus on the current state of science and identify key knowledge gaps underlying this issue. This article condenses the working group\u2019s report and presents a new research and policy agenda for understanding land use change and its effects on human health. Specifically, we discuss land-use drivers or human activities that exacerbate infectious diseases; the land\u2013water interface, common to many infectious disease life cycles; and conclusions and recommendations for research and training from the working group.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"__sec1title\" class=\"head no_bottom_margin ui-helper-clearfix\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #95f900;\">Land-Use Drivers of Infectious Disease Emergence<\/span><\/h2>\n<p id=\"__p7\" class=\"p p-first\">The emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) resulting from land use change can be entirely new to a specific location or host species. This may occur either from \u201cspillover\u201d or cross-species transmission or simply by extension of geographic range into new or changed habitats. More than 75% of human diseases are zoonotic and have a link to wildlife and domestic animals (<a id=\"__tag_98812696\" class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1247383\/#b54-ehp0112-001092\">Taylor et al. 2001<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p id=\"__p8\" class=\"p\">The working group developed an extensive list of processes by which land use affects human health (specifically, infectious disease occurrence) and of other factors that contribute to this relationship: agricultural development, urbanization, deforestation, population movement, increasing population, introduction of novel species\/pathogens, water and air pollution, biodiversity loss, habit fragmentation, road building, macro and micro climate changes, hydrological alteration, decline in public health infrastructure, animal-intensive systems, eutrophication, military conflict, monocropping, and erosion (ranked from highest to lowest public health impact by meeting participants). The four mechanisms that were felt to have the greatest impact on public health were changes to the physical environment; movement of populations, pathogens, and trade; agriculture; and urbanization. War and civil unrest were also mentioned as a potentially acute and cross-cutting driver.

Driven by rapidly increasing human population numbers, large swaths of species-rich tropical and temperate forests, as well as prairies, grasslands, and wetlands, have been converted to species-poor agricultural and ranching areas. The global rate of tropical deforestation continues at staggering levels, with nearly 2\u20133% of forests lost globally each year. Parallel with this habitat destruction is an exponential growth in human\u2013wildlife interaction and conflict. This has resulted in exposure to new pathogens for humans, livestock, and wildlife (<a class=\" bibr popnode\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1247383\/#b61-ehp0112-001092\">Wolfe et al. 2000<\/a>). Deforestation and the processes that lead to it have many consequences for ecosystems. Deforestation decreases the overall habitat available for wildlife species. It also modifies the structure of environments, for example, by fragmenting habitats into smaller patches separated by agricultural activities or human populations. Increased \u201cedge effect\u201d (from a patchwork of varied land uses) can further promote interaction among pathogens, vectors, and hosts. This edge effect has been well documented for Lyme disease (<a id=\"__tag_98812722\" class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1247383\/#b22-ehp0112-001092\">Glass et al. 1995<\/a>).

Because of the nature of food webs within ecosystems, organisms at higher trophic levels exist at a lower population density and are often quite sensitive to changes in food availability. The smaller patches left after fragmentation often do not have sufficient prey for top predators, resulting in local extinction of predator species and a subsequent increase in the density of their prey species. Logging and road building in Latin America have increased the incidence of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis (<a id=\"__tag_98812733\" class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1247383\/#b17-ehp0112-001092\">Desjeux 2001<\/a>), which in some areas has resulted from an increase in the number of fox reservoirs and sandfly vectors that have adapted to the peridomestic environment (<a id=\"__tag_98812715\" class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1247383\/#b43-ehp0112-001092\">Patz et al. 2000<\/a>).

Results suggest that the probability that a tick will become infected depends on not only the density of white-footed mice but also the density of mice relative to that of other hosts in the community. Under this scenario, the density effect of white-footed mice, which are efficient reservoirs for Lyme disease, can be \u201cdiluted\u201d by an increasing density of alternative hosts, which are less efficient at transmitting Lyme disease. These results suggest that increasing host diversity (species richness) may decrease the risk of disease through a \u201cdilution effect\u201d (<a class=\" bibr popnode\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1247383\/#b48-ehp0112-001092\">Schmidt and Ostfeld 2001<\/a>).<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"__sec5\" class=\"sec sec-last\">\n<h4 class=\"inline\">Extractive industries.<\/h4>\n<p id=\"__p14\" class=\"p p-first-last\">Gold mining is an extractive industry that damages local and regional environments and has adverse human health effects, because mercury is used to extract gold from riverbeds in the tropical forests.

These sometimes inadvertent, sometimes deliberate movements of infectious disease and vectors (e.g., the introduction of smallpox and measles to the Americas by Spanish conquistadors) will continue to rise via continually expanding global travel and by development of Third World populations. Human introduction of pathogens, hosts, or materials into new areas has been termed \u201cpathogen pollution\u201d (<a id=\"__tag_98812726\" class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1247383\/#b15-ehp0112-001092\">Daszak et al. 2000<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p id=\"__p16\">Land use changes drive some of these introductions and migrations and also increase the vulnerability of habitats and populations to these introductions. Human migrations also drive land use changes that in turn drive infectious disease emergence. For example, in China\u2019s Yunnan Province, an increase in livestock populations and migration has led to an increase in the incidence of schistosomiasis (<a id=\"__tag_98812719\" class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1247383\/#b27-ehp0112-001092\">Jiang et al. 1997<\/a>).

It is believed that the increased opportunity for contact between infected bats and pigs produced the outbreak of the disease in pigs, which then was transmitted to people in contact with infected pigs (<a class=\" bibr popnode\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1247383\/#b3-ehp0112-001092\">Aziz et al. 2002<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p id=\"__p17\">Another example of human-induced animal movement on a much larger scale is the international pet trade. This movement of animals involves many countries and allows for the introduction of novel pathogens, such as monkeypox, with the potential to damage ecosystems and threaten human and animal health. Monkeypox was originally associated with bushmeat hunting of red colobus monkeys (<em>Procolobus badius<\/em>); after a localized epidemic emerged in humans, monkeypox persisted for four generations via human-to-human contact (<a id=\"__tag_98812693\" class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1247383\/#b26-ehp0112-001092\">Jezek et al. 1986<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p id=\"__p18\" class=\"p\">Human movement also has significant implications for public health. Not only are travelers (tourists, businesspeople, and other workers) at risk of contracting communicable diseases when visiting tropical countries, but they also can act as vectors for delivering infectious diseases to another region or, in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), potentially around the world. Refugees account for a significant number of human migrants, carrying diseases such as hepatitis B and tuberculosis and various parasites (<a id=\"__tag_98812697\" class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1247383\/#b36-ehp0112-001092\">Loutan et al. 1997<\/a>). Because of their status, refugees become impoverished and are more exposed to a wide range of health risks. This is caused by the disruption of basic health services, inadequate food and medical care, and lack of clean water and sanitation (<a id=\"__tag_98812708\" class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1247383\/#b56-ehp0112-001092\">Toole and Waldman 1997<\/a>). People who cross international boundaries, such as travelers, immigrants, and refugees, may be at increased risk of contracting infectious diseases, especially those who have no immunity because the disease agents are uncommon in their native countries. Immigrants may come from nations where diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria are endemic, and refugees may come from situations where crowding and malnutrition create ideal conditions for the spread of diseases such as cholera, shigellosis, malaria, and measles [<a class=\" bibr popnode\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1247383\/#b6-ehp0112-001092\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 1998<\/a>].<\/p>\n<div id=\"__sec7\" class=\"sec sec-last\">\n<h4 class=\"inline\">Zoonoses.<\/h4>\n<p id=\"__p19\" class=\"p p-first\">The importance of zoonotic diseases should be emphasized. Zoonotic pathogens are the most significant cause of EIDs affecting humans, both in the proportion of EIDs that they cause and in the impact that they have. Some 1,415 species of infectious organisms are known to be pathogenic to people, with 61% of them being zoonotic. Of the emerging pathogens, 75% are zoonotic, and zoonotic pathogens are twice as likely to be associated with emerging diseases than are nonzoonotic pathogens (<a id=\"__tag_98812690\" class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1247383\/#b54-ehp0112-001092\">Taylor et al. 2001<\/a>). More important, zoonotic pathogens cause a series of EIDs with high case fatality rates and no reliable cure, vaccine, or therapy (e.g., Ebola virus disease, Nipah virus disease, and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome). Zoonotic pathogens also cause diseases that have some of the highest incidence rates globally [e.g., acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)]. AIDS is a special case, because it is caused by a pathogen that jumped host from nonhuman primates and then evolved into a new virus. Thus, it is in origin a zoonotic organism (<a id=\"__tag_98812729\" class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1247383\/#b23-ehp0112-001092\">Hahn et al. 2000<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p id=\"__p20\">Because of the important role of zoonoses in current public health threats, wildlife and domestic animals play a key role in the process by providing a \u201czoonotic pool\u201d from which previously unknown pathogens may emerge (<a id=\"__tag_98812714\" class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1247383\/#b16-ehp0112-001092\">Daszak et al. 2001<\/a>). The influenza virus is an example, causing pandemics in humans after periodic exchange of genes among the viruses of wild and domestic birds, pigs, and humans. Fruit bats are involved in a high-profile group of EIDs that includes rabies and other lyssaviruses, Hendra virus and Menangle virus (Australia), and Nipah virus (Malaysia and Singapore), which has implications for further zoonotic disease emergence. A number of species are endemic to both remote oceanic islands and more populous suburban and rural human settlements; these may harbor enzootic and potentially zoonotic pathogens with an unknown potential for spillover (<a id=\"__tag_98812721\" class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1247383\/#b15-ehp0112-001092\">Daszak et al. 2000<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p id=\"__p21\" class=\"p p-last\">Thus, some of the current major infectious threats to human health are EIDs and reemerging infectious diseases, with a particular emphasis on zoonotic pathogens transferring hosts from wildlife and domestic animals. A common, defining theme for most EIDs (of humans, wildlife, domestic animals, and plants) is that they are driven to emerge by anthropogenic changes to the environment. Because threats to wildlife habitat are so extensive and pervading, many of the currently important human EIDs (e.g., AIDS, Nipah virus disease) are driven partly by human-induced changes to wildlife habitat such as encroachment and deforestation. This is essentially a process of natural selection in which anthropogenic environmental changes perturb the host\u2013parasite dynamic equilibrium, leading to the expansion of those strains suited to the new environmental conditions and facilitating expansion of others into new host species (<a id=\"__tag_98812730\" class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1247383\/#b16-ehp0112-001092\">Daszak et al. 2001<\/a>).<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"__sec8\" class=\"sec\">\n<h3 class=\"inline\">Agriculture.<\/h3>\n<div id=\"__sec9\" class=\"sec sec-first\">\n<h4 class=\"inline\">Crop irrigation and breeding sites.<\/h4>\n<p id=\"__p22\" class=\"p p-first-last\">Agriculture occupies about half of the world\u2019s land and uses more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s fresh water (<a id=\"__tag_98812720\" class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1247383\/#b25-ehp0112-001092\">Horrigan et al. 2002<\/a>).

A conceptual framework of the MEA already provides an approach to optimize the contribution of ecosystems to human health (<a class=\" bibr popnode\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1247383\/#b39-ehp0112-001092\">MEA 2003<\/a>).

This conceptual framework focuses on human well-being while also recognizing associated intrinsic values. Similar to the MEA, focus is particularly on the linkages between ecosystem services and human health. Workshop participants developed a conceptual model (<a class=\"fig-table-link fig figpopup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1247383\/figure\/f1-ehp0112-001092\/\" target=\"figure\">Figure 1<\/a>). Like the MEA, it assumes a dynamic interaction between humans and ecosystems that warrants a multiscale assessment (spatial and temporal).<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"p p-first\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1247383\/bin\/ehp0112-001092f1.gif\" alt=\"Figure 1\" \/><\/p>\n<div id=\"__sec15\" class=\"sec sec-first\">\n<div id=\"__sec14\" class=\"tsec sec\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<div id=\"__sec15\" class=\"sec sec-first\">\n<p id=\"__p34\">By using this framework, policy makers may approach development and health at various levels. These levels include specific health risk factors, landscape or habitat change, and institutional (economic and behavioral) levels. For sound health policy, we must shift away from dealing primarily with specific risk factors and look \u201cupstream\u201d to underlying land-use determinants of infectious disease and ultimately the human behavior and established institutions that are detrimental to sustainable population health. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a similar DPSEEA (driving forces, pressures, state, exposure, effect, actions) model that in a similar way describes the interlinkage between human health and different driving forces and environmental change (<a class=\" bibr popnode\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1247383\/#b60-ehp0112-001092\">WHO 1997<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p id=\"__p35\" class=\"p p-last\">As such understanding increases, it will become more feasible to plan how to prevent new infectious disease emergence. Yet, because these are rare events, accurate predictions will remain daunting. It is already evident that inserting humans into complex ecosystems can lead to a variety of EIDs, but health outcomes depend on the economic circumstances of the human population. In poor and tropical communities, land use change can lead to major shifts in infectious disease patterns. For these situations, many conventional public health interventions can prevent several infectious diseases at relatively low cost. In rich and temperate-climate communities, the infectious disease shifts tend to be more disease specific, for example, in the case of Lyme disease and habitat fragmentation.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"__sec16\" class=\"sec\">\n<h3 class=\"inline\">Research on deforestation and infectious disease.<\/h3>\n<p id=\"__p36\" class=\"p p-first\">Considering the deforestation that usually accompanies agricultural development, new conservation-oriented agriculture should be pursued. As discussed above, water project development and modern livestock management present major health disease risks. However, often the secondary unintended consequences can also wreak havoc; for example, a leaking dam may present greater risks than the reservoir itself. A distressingly large number of development projects not only have adverse effects on human health but also fail to attain their primary economic purposes in a sustainable manner.<\/p>\n<p id=\"__p37\">Habitat fragmentation, whether caused by forest destruction, desertification, or land-use conversion, affects human and wildlife health and ecosystem processes. There is already much research undertaken by landscape ecologists on the consequences of habitat fragmentation for wildlife, especially larger animals. It would be important to study the effects of landscape fragmentation on public health hazards. Such research could entail three components. The first component consists of gathering baseline data, including using historical data where possible and beginning monitoring programs where necessary. Key data include identifying and quantifying the relevant pathogen load of wildlife, livestock, and human communities in fragmented landscapes. The goals of this data collection are, first, to identify key infectious diseases, both chronic and emergent or reemergent and, second, to document the consequences of fragmentation on relative abundance of wildlife and subsequent pathogen load. For example, the loss of large predators in fragmented habitats in the northeastern United States has led to a superabundance of rodent vectors for Lyme disease.<\/p>\n<p id=\"__p38\">The second component of the research program would involve health impact modeling, primarily in three areas:\u00a0<em>a<\/em>) estimating changes in the relative abundance of organisms, including infectious disease vectors, pathogens, and hosts;\u00a0<em>b<\/em>) projecting potential vector or transmission shifts (e.g., should the Nipah virus shift to pulmonary as well as neurologic expression in humans as in swine); and\u00a0<em>c<\/em>) projecting the impact of infectious diseases in a region on different geographic scales.<\/p>\n<p id=\"__p39\" class=\"p p-last\">The results of these analyses, if successful, could support the third component of research: development of decision-support tools. Improved decisions on land-use policy could be made from a better understanding of costs and benefits to health and environmental decision makers. In all probability, however, they will be very location specific. For example, to construct an irrigation scheme in India would likely invite a malaria epidemic, whereas the same activity in sub-Saharan Africa may have little effect on malaria transmission. It is worth mentioning that costs and benefits could depend on the time course over which they are assessed. For example, some land-use changes can lead to short-term increases in transmission followed by longer-term decreases (e.g., irrigation and malaria in Sri Lanka) or vice versa (e.g., deforestation and cutaneous leishmaniasis in Latin America).<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"__sec17\" class=\"sec\">\n<h3 class=\"inline\">Policies to reduce microbial traffic\/pathogen pollution.<\/h3>\n<p id=\"__p40\" class=\"p p-first\">In today\u2019s interconnected world, it becomes very important to invest in the worldwide control of infectious diseases in developing countries, for example. It is also necessary to control transport to stem the flow from one place to the next.<\/p>\n<p id=\"__p41\" class=\"p p-last\">Improved monitoring of trade is warranted in order to target infectious disease introductions. In the attempt to prevent the invasion of a pathogen (and drug-resistant organisms) into the vulnerable areas subject to land use changes, we need to pay greater attention to controls at the sources. We need to document and map these trades and investigate the vectors, the infectious diseases they harbor, and the populations they threaten. Risk assessment should guide surveillance and the development of test kits, targeting point-of-origin intervention to preempt these processes. Assessments must further include nonmarket costs (usually to the detriment of the environment and long-term sustainable health). We should communicate to both the exporters and consumers the need to make their trades clean, economically viable, and certified \u201cclean and green\u201d by an independent scientific agency at the source and\/or destination. Additionally, strategies for screening travelers for pathogens that may be introduced to a region should be improved.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"__sec18\" class=\"sec sec-last\">\n<h3 class=\"inline\">Centers of Excellence in Ecology and Health Research and Training.<\/h3>\n<p id=\"__p42\" class=\"p p-first\">One approach to developing the issues to which this article draws attention is the creation of a system of regional- or subregional-based interdisciplinary Centers of Excellence in Ecology and Health Research and Training. Based at regional universities and\/or research institutes but with very close links to the surrounding communities, these centers would have the following objectives:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"unordered\">\n<li>\n<div>Providing information based on good science to local communities about the links between environmental change and public health, including the factors that contribute to specific infectious disease outbreaks.

Training local professionals in environmental, agricultural, and health science issues, with a particular focus on granting degrees in a new \u201ctrans\u201d-discipline linking health and the environment, would be emphasized.<\/div>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<div>Acting as centers of integrated analysis of infectious disease emergence, incorporating perspectives and expertise from a variety of natural, social, and health sciences.

In addition, research projects should take place in regions or landscapes that have both well characterized and less characterized patterns of infectious disease emergence or transmission for comparison purposes. Local health and environment professionals, who are in the best position to understand local priorities, should make the choices within each region for initial research areas and sites.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"__sec20\" class=\"sec sec-last\">\n<h4 class=\"inline\">Addressing trade-offs among environment, health, and development.<\/h4>\n<p id=\"__p48\" class=\"p p-first-last\">There are some inherent trade-offs when considering land-use change and health. They are ethical values, environmental versus health choices, and disparities in knowledge and economic class. Trade-offs are between short-term benefit and long-term damage. For example, draining swamps may reduce vector-borne disease hazards but also destroy the wetland ecosystem and its inherent services (e.g., water storage, water filtration, biologic productivity, and habitats for fish and wildlife). Research can help decision making by identifying and assessing trade-offs in different land-use-change scenarios. Balancing the diverse needs of people, livestock, wildlife, and the ecosystem will always be a prominent feature.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"__sec21\" class=\"tsec sec\">\n<div class=\"goto jig-ncbiinpagenav-goto-container\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a class=\"tgt_dark page-toc-label jig-ncbiinpagenav-goto-heading\" title=\"Go to other sections in this page\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1247383\/#\">Go to:<\/a><\/div>\n<h2 id=\"__sec21title\" class=\"head no_bottom_margin ui-helper-clearfix\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Conclusions<\/h2>\n<p id=\"__p49\" class=\"p p-first\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">When considering issues of land use and infectious disease emergence, the public needs to be attentive to entire ecosystems rather than simply their local environs.

Second, if the work is to influence policy, the choice of questions and the research must be undertaken collaboratively with the local community and also through discussion with decision makers in government, industry, civil society, and other sectors. Third, investigators must consider how they can integrate their findings into the social, economic, and political dialogue on both the environment and health, globally and locally. As links between land use and health are elucidated, an informed public will more readily use such discoveries to better generate political will for effective change.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text] ABSTRACT Anthropogenic land use changes drive a range of infectious disease outbreaks and emergence events and modify the transmission of endemic infections.
