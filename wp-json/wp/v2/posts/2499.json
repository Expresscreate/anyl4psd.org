The achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals will improve the lives of all, prevent natural and man-made crises and lay a solid foundation for human rights, stability, prosperity and peace in all communities. Addressing DLDD will involve long-term integrated strategies that simultaneously focus on the improved productivity of land and the rehabilitation, conservation and sustainable management of land and water resources. The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) can play a central role in addressing these issues through capacity-building, the sharing of successful experiences, technology transfer, the provision of scientific support, awareness-raising, mobilization of resources and the provision of assistance to countries in implementing policies at national, subregional, regional and international levels.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_column_text 0=&#8221;&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is a need for Cameroon and African states to develop new capabilities and transform working methods to enable more societal responses; there is a need to respond to all of the development challenges of our time, as set out in the 2030 Agenda.
