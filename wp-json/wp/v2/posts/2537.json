Research works done in some high schools in the town and Yaound\u00e9 permitted us to check the presence of the construction of these infrastructures. To achieve our objectives, we went to the field in the months of November 2015 and January 2016 permitted us to achieve discussion with 283 actors of WASH in the scholar milieu to make direct observation at last they permitted us to collect water and to evaluate their quality in the lab.<br \/>\nResults obtained shows that students are average per hall are 91, the ratio person\/point of water are between 786 and 3826, a bacterial contamination of water between 9 and 344 UCF\/ 100 ml. We obtained the ratio person\/ latrine toilet is in between 171 and 1250, the teachers have no training, no didactics in WASH domain.

En absence d\u2019infrastructures d\u2019approvisionnement en eau, de dispositif de lavage des mains et de toilettes en bon \u00e9tat, les maladies se d\u00e9veloppent et se propagent rapidement, le milieu scolaire devient un espace \u00e0 haut risque pour les \u00e9l\u00e8ves et les enseignants. Le travail de recherche men\u00e9 dans quelques lyc\u00e9es de la ville de Yaound\u00e9 a permis de v\u00e9rifier l\u2019op\u00e9rationnalisation de la construction de ces infrastructures. Pour atteindre nos objectifs, les descentes sur le terrain entre les mois de Novembre 2015 et de Janvier 2016 ont permis de r\u00e9aliser des entretiens avec 283 acteurs du WASH en milieu scolaire, de faire des observations directes.<br \/>\nEnfin elles ont permis de pr\u00e9lever les eaux et d\u2019\u00e9valuer leurs qualit\u00e9s en laboratoire.<br \/>\nLes r\u00e9sultats obtenus montrent que la moyenne d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ves par salle de classe est de 91, les ratios personnes\/point d\u2019eau sont compris entre 786 et 3826.
