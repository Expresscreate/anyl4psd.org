Throughout its history, Cameroon and others African countries have experienced migratory movements, both voluntary and forced, which have contributed to its contemporary demographic landscape. In many parts of the continent, communities are spread across two or three nation-States, and movement is often not limited by political boundaries. Cross-border migration in Africa is an important livelihood and coping strategy during times of ecological and economic downturn is key to understanding, as well as forecasting, the onset and evolution of humanitarian disasters.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The global geo-political prominence of migration has greatly increased in recent times, as the world sees larger numbers of migrants than at any other time in history. The number of international migrants reached 244 million in 2015, a 41 per cent increase on the 2000 figure, whilst the number of international migrants from Africa reached 34 million, with nearly half of them being women. \u00a0Moreover, more people have been forcibly displaced than during, or any time since World War II, with figures reaching over 65 million by the end of 2015. These trends take shape against the backdrop of the growing securitizations of migration, the externalization of border control and increasingly restrictive migration policies, which have contributed to irregular migration. Global inequality, the lack of decent work, poverty, conflict, gender inequalities and discrimination, terrorism and climatic pressure continue to drive people to search for a better life abroad. Mixed flows, consisting of different types of migrants and asylum seekers that use the same migration routes and means, have been on the rise. As legal pathways for migration have diminished, migrants are falling prey to smugglers and human traffickers. Consequently the lack of legal pathways for migration has contributed to record numbers of deaths in the Mediterranean Sea, with more than 5,000 people losing their lives in 2016 alone. Reliable data on migrant deaths on other routes remain scanty, which means that even more people may be dying crossing the Red Sea and the Sahara Desert. These dynamics have strained and called into question the world\u2019s refugee system, which is struggling to provide adequate protection to more than 21 million refugees. In addition, the notion of a growing migration \u201ccrisis\u201d and international terrorism have led to policies that seek to deter migration and jeopardise the protection of the rights of migrant women and men.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The root causes of migration in Africa are numerous and inter-related. The push-pull framework provides insight into this complex web of factors. Lack of socio-economic opportunities and the rule of law, poor governance, patronage and corruption, political instability, conflict, terrorism and civil strife are major push factors. Pull factors include the real or perceived opportunities for a better life, higher income, improved security, and superior education and health care in countries of destination. The push-pull dynamic is intensified by a number of other factors that facilitate migration. These include the lower costs of migration; improved communication, especially social media and the internet; greater information availability; and the need to join relatives, families and friends. The movement of people &#8211; voluntary or forced, legal or undocumented, within or across borders &#8211; is a complex process that affects policy making in a wide range of areas.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Over the last decade, a salient trend in African migration has been the rise in irregular migration. Migrants use increasingly precarious routes, which render them vulnerable to abuse by smugglers and traffickers. Women and girls are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking, sexual and gender-based violence, and other risks. Moreover, States often view irregular migration through the prism of national security, which may lead to a generalization that all refugees and migrants are a potential security threat. This has contributed to the securitization of migration, including the reinforcement of border control, without due respect for migrants\u2019 human rights.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Furthermore, corruption and harassment at borders in Africa remain a challenge, even in regions that are implementing free movement of persons regimes, and this too undermines the human rights of migrants. Migration management policies and practices should uphold the human rights of all migrants, while awareness raising on the rights and obligations of migrants should be provided, as well as migrant-friendly reporting and accountability mechanisms, that address abuse and the exploitation of migrants by security and law enforcement officials. Another major challenge in Africa is displaced populations, inter alia triggered by conflict, terrorism, and climatic pressure.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Migration is a global concern. It is the reason why the Global Compact on orderly and safe migration has been created under the auspice of the United Nations.\u00a0 The\u00a0Global\u00a0Compact\u00a0is the first-ever negotiated\u00a0global\u00a0framework on a common approach to international migration in all its dimensions.\u00a0 However, other of the major challenges concerning migration management in Cameroon and Africa are related to less evidence based and the lack of comprehensive policies or plans to improve the lives of migrants and the communities in which they live, and the possibility to reduce dangerous, chaotic and irregular migration flows.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A lot of Cameroonians and Africans are not sufficiently aware of the consequences of irregular migrations and the conditions of regular migrations. There is a need to increase intrastate, interstates, continental and intercontinental partnerships.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #95f900;\">PROGRAM IDEAS AND VALUES<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>This program is based on three major Ideas:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<blockquote><p>human beings\u00a0 in affected \/ threatened ( whether in homeland or in host land)\u00a0 are at the center of concerns joint action should be undertaken to ensure their rights, peace and security;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<blockquote><p>Migration governance; labour migration and Education; border governance; irregular migration; forced displacement, internal migration; migration and trade Desertification, drought, climate change, peacebuilding, corruption, transparency are concerns of global dimension and joint action is needed to cope with them;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The recognition that effective migration policies, and greater protection of the vulnerable, require the support of many actors. This requires the engagement of a broad alliance of partners, including civil society, the private sector, trade unions, diaspora and migrant communities, national human rights institutions, local authorities, youth networks and other actors.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #95f900;\">PROGRAM PRINCIPLES<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The Action Program Against Migration and Trafficking is based on a set of cross-cutting and interdependent guiding principles:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>People-centered<\/strong>: promoting the well-being of migrants and the members of communities in countries of origin, transit and destination<\/li>\n<li><strong>International cooperation<\/strong>: requiring international, regional and bilateral cooperation and dialogue. I<\/li>\n<li><strong>National sovereignty<\/strong>: sovereign right of States to determine their national migration policy and their prerogative to govern migration within their jurisdiction, in conformity with international law.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Rule of law and due process<\/strong>: State, public and private institutions and entities, as well as persons themselves are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated, equally enforced and independently adjudicated, and which are consistent with international law.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sustainable development<\/strong>: rooted in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and builds upon its recognition that migration is a multidimensional reality of major relevance for the sustainable development of countries of origin, transit and destination, which requires coherent and comprehensive responses<\/li>\n<li><strong>Human rights<\/strong>: based on international human rights law and upholds the principles of non-regression and non-discrimination<\/li>\n<li><strong>Gender-responsive<\/strong>: ensures that the human rights of women, men, girls and boys are respected at all stages of migration, their specific needs are properly understood and addressed and they are empowered as agents of change<\/li>\n<li><strong>Child-sensitive<\/strong>: promotes existing international legal obligations in relation to the rights of the child, and upholds the principle of the best interests of the child at all times, as a primary consideration in all situations concerning children in the context of international migration, including unaccompanied and separated children<\/li>\n<li><strong>Whole-of-government approach<\/strong>: considers that migration is a multidimensional reality that cannot be addressed by one government policy sector alone.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Whole-of-society approach<\/strong>: promotes broad multi-stakeholder partnerships to address migration in all its dimensions by including migrants, diasporas, local communities, civil society, academia, the private sector, parliamentarians, trade unions, National Human Rights Institutions, the media and other relevant stakeholders in migration governance<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #95f900;\">STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND EXPECTED IMPACT<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><strong><em><u>Strategic objective
