The International Geneva Symposium organized in April 2006 by Switzerland on the question of desertification, poverty and human rights highlighted the necessity of protecting land and soil to achieve the MDGs and protect human rights. Since then, the latest reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC that projects patterns of natural resources scarcity under scenarios of climate change grimly remind us that handling such issues with benign neglect shall no longer suffice. This was fully recognized by the 8th session of the Conference of Parties of the UNCCD which adopted in Madrid in September 2007 a forward looking 10 Year Strategy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Despite real advances in Cameroon and African Countries there has been little progress overall in reducing the number of victims of climate change and desertification leading to several consequences as food and water insecurity, migrations, unemployment and conflicts with negative impact on human health.<br \/>\nThe number of people suffering from hunger has increased every year since 1996, despite government commitments to halve hunger in international summits for food. Every five seconds, a child under 10 dies from hunger and malnutrition-related diseases.<br \/>\nHalf of hungry people therefore depend for their survival on lands which are inherently poor and which may be becoming less fertile and less productive as a result of the impacts of repeated droughts, climate change and unsustainable land use. In Africa as in many regions of Cameroon a lot of productive lands are dryland. An important part of the population is predominantly rural, poor and more frequently subject to food crises. In some part of Cameroon and Africa, the overwhelming majority of the poor live in rural areas and poverty is deepest in the low rainfall areas. Land degradation also causes migration and intensifies conflict over resources, particularly between pastoral and farming communities.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many of the ongoing conflicts and food crises are the result of the impact of serious drought, desertification and land degradation and rising conflict over deteriorating resources. In arid regions around, as the land becomes as hard as concrete and the wells dry up, thousands of families are forced to leave their villages. Deprived of their lands and their subsistence, families suffer from permanent unemployment, hunger and desperation. It is now estimated that there are thousands of \u201cecological refugees\u201d or \u201cenvironmental migrants\u201d in Cameroun and millions in Africa. \u201cEcological refugees\u201d or \u201cenvironmental migrants\u201d understood as people who have been forced to flee from their lands as a result of natural disasters, including floods, drought and desertification, and end up struggling to survive in the slums of the world\u2019s megacities.<br \/>\nDesertification is a silent, invisible crisis that is destabilizing communities. As the effects of climate change undermine livelihoods, inter-ethnic clashes are breaking out within and across states and fragile states are turning to militarization to control the situation. The effects of desertification are increasingly felt globally as victims turn into refugees, internally displaced people and forced migrants or they turn to radicalization, extremism or resource-driven wars for survival. Local conflicts over water or land turned into civil wars, sexual violence or genocide<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Land degradation in our countries is a problem that affects not only the drylands. About one third of all agricultural land is either highly or moderately degraded. If drylands are more vulnerable to natural and human destruction due to the small water containment in soil.<br \/>\nMore than 50% of the lands under agriculture are degraded. Millions hectares of productive land become barren each year due to desertification and drought alone. This constitutes a lost opportunity to produce a lot of tons of food. Agricultural yields are falling because of unchanged bad production practices.<br \/>\nDeforestation, chemical pollution and inappropriate land management which is compounded by recurrent severe droughts, lead to declining ground water supplies impacting agriculture, fishing and lead to disasters affecting the most women, youth, children, indigenous people and their communities and their business. Most African countries don\u2019t have a national drought policy.<br \/>\nThe Program will contribute to (i) achieving the objectives of the Convention and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in particular regarding Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15 and target 15.3: \u201cby 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world\u201d and other interrelated SDGs, within the scope of the Convention; (ii) improving the living conditions of affected populations; and (iii) enhancing ecosystems services.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #95f900;\">PROGRAM IDEAS AND VALUES<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><strong>This program is based on two major ideas:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Human beings in affected or threatened areas are at the center of concerns to combat desertification\/land degradation, and mitigate the effects of drought and climate change.<\/li>\n<li>Desertification\/land degradation, drought and Climate Change, are problems of global dimension and joint action of the international community is needed to combat desertification\/land degradation and mitigate the effects of drought and climate change.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>To give a concrete meaning to these ideas, three principles are the core of this program:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, African States have the primary role in combating desertification\/land degradation and mitigate the effects of drought and climate change.<\/li>\n<li>Second, it is essential to ensure the participation of NGOs, CSO, farmers, women,\u00a0\u00a0Scientifics community, youth and children, Indigenous Peoples and their communities, business and industry, workers and trade unions in the elaboration, implementation and monitoring of national and local programs<\/li>\n<li>Third, developed States must actively support, individually or jointly, the efforts of African developing and least developing countries, to combat desertification\/land degradation and mitigate the effects of drought and climate change.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #95f900;\">PROGRAM VISION<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Living conditions are improved thanks to multi actors\u2019 participation in environmental\/ land management to avoid, minimize, and reverse desertification\/land degradation, and mitigate the effects of drought in affected areas at all levels to achieve a land degradation-neutral world consistent with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Africa.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #95f900;\">STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND EXPECTED IMPACT<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The following \u201cstrategic objectives\u201d will guide the actions of ANYL4PSD in the period 2018\u20132030.
