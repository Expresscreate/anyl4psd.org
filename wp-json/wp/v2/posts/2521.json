But corruption is present in all sectors of the public and private life. Thus, the fight against corruption is among priorities of Cameroonian and African authorities as indicated in the strategic guideline documents related to poverty reduction, growth and employment strategy papers and regarding to their vision of development.<br \/>\nTo tackle the phenomenon, many African countries have set down institutional and legal anti-corruption mechanisms and have adhere to regional and international anti-corruption and transparency conventions and processes like the African Union Convention on preventing and combatting corruption, the United Nations Conventions against Corruption (UNCAC), and the Kimberly Process relating to Transparency in Extractive Industries.<br \/>\nDespite all these instruments, the results so far in the fight against corruption remained mixed. The phenomenon still rampant and has become like a culture in many aspects of Cameroonian life.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Corruption is a cross-cutting issue that undermines the achievement of sustainable development agenda. Millions of Cameroonians and African suffer from hunger, poverty; do not have access to health and wellbeing, to an education of quality because of corruption. Corruption has a negative impact on gender equity. Sometimes, to have access to the same opportunities like men, girls and women are asked to give money for a certain position. Corruption hinders many African (especially minority, vulnerable people, to have access to water and energy at affordable price. Millions of African do not have a job or a decent job because of corruption. African industrialization delays because of corruption in investment and public market sector. Many vulnerable people including women and youth are deprived from their rights to land because of corruption. Corruption is one of the major causes of migration in Africa. Promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all and building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels require tackling corruption. We can\u2019t significantly reduce inequality within and among countries, make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable can, ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns, combat climate change and its impacts; protecting, restoring and promoting sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combating desertification, and halting and reversing land degradation and halting biodiversity loss. If measures are not addressed against corruption.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In many African countries a great majority of citizens (especially vulnerable people, young and women), public and private institutions are not yet fully aware of the challenges and the takes of anti-corruption.<br \/>\nYet, it should be underlined that this scourge with damaging effects, if left to grow, is tantamount to dash all our hopes for prosperity and common happiness. If we do not act now, it might be too late tomorrow and our aspirations for welfare would be drowned if we fail in combating our common enemy that is corruption.<br \/>\nOne of the reasons of the poor performance in anti-corruption is the scattering of efforts by multiple public and private organizations in a bid to curb the scourge. Indeed, in the anti-corruption actions carried out in by public and private sector institutions or Civil Society organizations, there is no synchronization in the implementation process. However, the creation of positive networks is one of the key factors to success in the fight against corruption.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #95f900;\">PROJECT VISION<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By 2030, thanks to the decisive contribution of children, young people, women and men, and the jointly synchronization among public, private sectors and civil society in implementing the United Nations Convention Against Corruption and African Convention on Preventing and Combatting Corruption, Cameroon and African countries are countries where integrity is an essential value for every citizen, with an economic growth based on the job well done, distributed equitably to ensure social welfare in a preserved environment consistent with 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #95f900;\">STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND EXPECTED IMPACT<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><u>Strategic Objectives and expected impact<\/u><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><em>Strategic objective 1<\/em><\/strong><strong>: To improve people understanding on corruption and extractive industries impact on sustainable development. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Expected impact 1.1<\/em><\/strong><em>: Ignorance and misunderstanding of people about the challenges and the impact of corruption in the achievement of sustainable development goals are reduced.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Expected Impact 1.2:<\/em><\/strong><em> Measures to improve fighting corruption are shared and debated<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Expected Impact 1.3<\/em><\/strong><em>: Increased number of youths, women, and indigenous people trained on extractive Industries Transparency and anticorruption and access to related documentation.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Strategic objective 2: To increase countriesengagement towards anti-corruption<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Expected impact 2.1 <\/em><\/strong><em>Increased number administrations, civil society organizations, companies and media integrate anticorruption in their strategy, functioning and culture. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Expected Impact 2.2: <\/em><\/strong><em>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increased synergy and coordination among public institutions, private sector, civil society and the media in the promotion, development and implementation of anti-corruption, transparency mechanisms and extractive industries transparency process<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Expected Impact 2.3:<\/em><\/strong><em> National and sectorial action plans concerning anti-corruption (with their targets) are set by countries with the contribution of civil society and private sector; related measures are identified and implemented (following the strategic axis of prevention, Education, Conditions, Incentives, and sanctions), with a necessary inclusive monitoring system is established and effective. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Expected Impact 2.4: <\/em><\/strong><em>Governments,private sector, civil society and citizen (especially women, children, youth and other minority groups) individually and collectively monitor countries progress in achieving anti-corruption\/extractive industries transparency initiative action plans and strategies. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Expected Impact 2.5<\/em><\/strong><em>: Revised and adapted anticorruption, transparency (including in extractive industries) frameworks; reduced bad practices and whistleblowers violations. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Strategic objective 3: To improve living conditions of populations (especially affected populations: vulnerable\/minority people, women, youth, children, and indigenous people)<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Expected impact 3.1<\/em><\/strong><em>: \u00a0Transparency and accountability improved in the management of public affairs in all sectors of national life especially in the public investment budget, public markets, finance, Education, Agriculture, extractive industries, water and energy, and forest and land governance and decentralization<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Expected impact 3.2<\/em><\/strong><em>Localpeople, especially women and youth, are empowered and participate in decision-making processes in fighting corruption, monitor the public action and denounce bad practices.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Expected impact 3.2<\/em><\/strong><em>The livelihoods and living conditions of populations especially vulnerable\/minority people (women, youth, children, and indigenous people) are improved \/and diversified.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u00a0CONTEXT Cameroon and African Countries have enormous potentialities and resources that can enable them to be progress.
