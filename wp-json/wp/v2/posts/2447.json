They defy easy analysis and our understanding of the phenomenon remains incomplete. Recent attacks such as the one conducted at Garissa University in Kenya, where 147 people, mostly students, were killed; confront us with the problematic nature of many of our common assumptions: one of the main attackers, a successful lawyer from a wealthy family was not necessarily \u201cmarginalized\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d. Furthermore, while we understand that youth grievances, alienation and poor governance play a significant role in violent extremism motivated by religion, we do not know why such youth do not opt for non-violent. Lastly, while we are certain that context matters, we do not know why two children raised in the same family, who experience similar socio-economic foundations and have similar levels of education and communal integration might take dramatically different paths.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Despite these gaps and uncertainties, we can identify common processes, drivers and enablers that operate at individual, group, and community, national, regional and global levels. However, \u2018when-<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Programme Values<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The values of this program can be summarized in the following four (5) points:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Respect for human rights and the rights of indigenous peoples<\/li>\n<li>Gender equality<\/li>\n<li>Cooperation, partnership and solidarity<\/li>\n<li>Good governance<\/li>\n<li>Youth Participation and Inclusion<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Programme Vision<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Africa is a secured continent with an economic growth and improved living conditions thanks to multi-actors implication and collaboration (including vulnerable and marginalized people) in development of strengthened responses to mitigate the growth of violent extremism consistent with the 2030 agenda on sustainable development.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">why-and-how\u2019 these diverse constellations converge to produce violent extremism requires deeper context-specific analysis.<br \/>\nFirst, at the individual level, susceptibility to powerful messaging, narratives and imagery via social media networks and person-to-person channels has been highlighted by several researchers as being particularly significant in the context of violent extremism. The predisposition to adopt new or adapted value systems and world views focused on, for example, \u201cus\u201d versus \u201cthem\u201d narratives, the singularity of claims and the desire to restore Islam to an ancient utopia is however dependent both on the psychological make-up of the individual in question and the extent to which other factors at the group, community, national and international levels have increased his\/her vulnerability to processes associated with violent extremism.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At this level, an understanding of radicalization as a dynamic process is paramount. However, such processes are nonlinear and the \u201ctipping point\u201d at which violence becomes perceived as an acceptable, necessary or even desirable means to express one\u2019s radical viewpoint and achieve one\u2019s goals is not fully understood. At the group level, the family is a fundamental unit for understanding violent extremism, but not the only one. The vulnerability of youth appears to be increasing, in part as a result of weak family cohesion and the absence of critical family support. In societies already affected by conflict and fragility, vulnerability may be enhanced as a result of an absent father who may be active in the conflict or seeking employment opportunities abroad.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The family unit aside, peer groups \u2013 on and offline \u2013 can also play a critical role in preventing or facilitating processes associated with violent extremism. Recruiters, especially, play a key role in seeking out vulnerable youth, and providing them with new identities and\/or serving as potential father-figures.<br \/>\nLastly, at the group level, youth often have no access to extra-curricular activities such as sports and other hobbies or access to role models and mentors that can help to enhance social cohesion. At the level of the community, several formal and informal institutions and dynamics play critical roles. First, religious institutions are particularly keys. Imams, mosques and madrassas may be insufficiently prepared to play the effective guidance role that may be required of them, especially when internal institutional governance mechanisms are weak or lacking. In such instances, religious institutions become easy targets for recruiters, takeover by extremist groups and for the propagation of extremist-related messaging.<br \/>\nHowever, as there is little quality control over the curriculum, mosques and madrassas have free reign to teach and preach what they choose. As a result, religious institutions become easy targets for the proliferation of extremist ideologies. Second, many communities feel excluded from political structures and processes due to the absence of State-society platforms and suffer from l<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The manner, in which the responsibilities of the State are\/are not executed, can be a significant driver of violent extremism, especially when combined with several of the other elements already discussed. The weak capacity of the State combined with high levels of corruption, unaccountable public administration, weak or ineffective judicial systems and security services perceived as serving the political interests of elites rather than protecting the rights of citizens are all actively fueling the rapid growth of radicalization across the African continent.<br \/>\nIn some sub-Saharan countries, the inability of the State to provide for basic services and governance mechanisms is creating contested and\/or ungoverned spaces. In such instances, religious groups are often stepping in to address the need for services such as healthcare, education and infrastructure. Radicalization that gives rise to violence can appear strongest in those regions where marginalization is combined with a desire for political autonomy, and often a resurgence of patriotic zeal. Evidently, instances of State failure or collapse can provide a haven for extremist groups. Diverse factors conflate at both the regional and transnational levels to foster the conditions that can ignite and sustain the growth of violent extremism in Africa.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As already highlighted, at the trans-national and regional level, porous borders facilitate the trafficking of small arms and light weapons (SALW), people, drugs and goods that are vital for such groups, often blurring the distinction between violent armed groups and trans-national criminal networks. The high levels of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees is further destabilizing the continent, exacerbating the vulnerability of already marginalized populations, and making refugee camps and on-the-move population easy targets for radicalized groups.<br \/>\nAt the global level, many factors can fuel violent extremism and three in particular have been highlighted. First, the so-called Arab Spring period provided a catalyst for the rapid growth of violent extremism in Africa. Although the uprising itself evidently did not serve as a catalyst, the response, or lack thereof, of many States across the region to the protests fueled frustration, marginalization and, in some cases, extremism. The situation in Libya, for example, has helped create a wave of insurgencies that are engulfing the sub-region and perpetuating instability.<br \/>\nMany narratives of violent extremists are based on the notion that the international community is failing to defend Muslims and such rhetoric is often used to justify violence against \u2018the West\u2019. Second, globalization and the rapid spread of access to media and new technologies appear to be exacerbating the perceptions of relative deprivation and the ever-increasing gap between rich and poor.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #95f900;\">STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND EXPECTED IMPACT<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The following \u201cstrategic objectives\u201d will guide the actions of ANYL4PSD.
