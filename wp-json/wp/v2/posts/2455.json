Hundreds of women have been driven from their homes. Many communities are facing famine, extreme weather events, poorly managed urbanization, early marriage and childbirth, population growth, water scarcity, armed conflict, gender-based violence, ethnic discrimination, religious or political and increasing violent extremism. At the international level, series of historic agreements were concluded in 2015 \u2013 the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the UN Climate Change Action Program and Addis Ababa third International Conference on Financing for Development \u2013 A Better Future-.<br \/>\nThese efforts were complemented by the peace resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council (Assembly resolution 70\/262 and Council resolution 2282 (2016)), as well as the new way of working in emergency and crisis situations. These comprehensive and interdependent agreements, which transcend the pillars of peace, development and human rights of the United Nations, provide a clear roadmap for Member States (African in particular) and the United Nations system.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1534540816441{background-color: #95f900 !important;}&#8221;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Universal in its coverage, the 2030 Agenda applies to all countries and commits the international community to leave no one behind. The achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals will improve the lives of all, prevent natural and man-made crises and lay a solid foundation for human rights, stability, prosperity and peace in all communities. Addressing DLDD will involve long-term integrated strategies that simultaneously focus on the improved productivity of land and the rehabilitation, conservation and sustainable management of land and water resources.<br \/>\nThere is a need for states to develop new capabilities and transform working methods to enable more societal responses. There is a need to respond to all of the development challenges of our time, as set out in the 2030 Agenda. It requires greater accountability, greater transparency and control, and calls for greater coherence at all levels, especially through a reinvigorated resident coordinator system.<br \/>\nConceptually, Global goals ambition requires a \u201cwhole-of-government\u201d approach. The current development landscape presents an inspiring range of new actors. Powerful national forces, covering all levels: government, civil society, academia, the scientific community and the private sector, from microenterprises to multinationals, need to come together to fight poverty. This reflects the underlying vision of the global partnership in the 2030 Agenda \u2013 where governments, the private sector, civil society and the United Nations work together to mobilize all available resources, which can be a potential asset.<br \/>\nBut to realize the promise of a prosperous and peaceful future, these development actors have to find new ways to work together and leverage genuine partnerships that make the most of the expertise, technology and resources for growth sustainable and inclusive.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The rapid evolution of alternative forms of development cooperation, including the intensification of South-South cooperation to achieve the goals. By promising to leave no one behind, the 2030 Agenda calls for multi-stakeholder collaboration among policymakers, development practitioners and multilateral agencies to ensure that everyone is aware of the existence and substance of the program sustainable development agenda and included in the process of its implementation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After having made interviews with young leaders in Cameroon an in some African States like Niger, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Comoros Islands, Senegal, Nigeria, Gabon and Morocco, it appears that young people and children feel themselves not very included by Governments in the implementation of sustainable development agenda. Several initiatives put in place by Governments, remain barely visible and known by young people, whose levels of membership remain relatively weak because they do not have the assurance that their aspirations are sufficiently taken into account. There is not a real discussion among vulnerable people, states, civil society, international organizations and the United Nations agencies on sustainable development agenda.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sustainable development Agenda has been adopted by Government but is still not known by young people, the private sector and many stakeholders who do not always play their role in the implementation. There are young people (even from vulnerable\/minority groups) who are doing a great job towards achieving the sustainable development goals. But their initiatives are still not well- known, not supported by Governments, NGOs and private sector. There are very few opportunities for discussion between youths and other stakeholders on the sustainable development agenda.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text][\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #95f900;\">VISION AND OVERALL GOAL<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Vision<\/strong><br \/>\nBy 2030, by contributing to the realization of the United Nations vision and the sustainable development agenda, African states have a growing economy and abundant biodiversity in a secure, democratic, peaceful and respectful human rights space for the well-being of the people thanks to the strengthened capacities of the actors, the stakeholders, the communities and to the concerted and participative management \u201c.<br \/>\n<strong>Overall Goal&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\nTo enhancing multi-stakeholders (Governments, NGOs, farmers, Scientifics, community, youth and children, women, Indigenous Peoples and their communities, business and industry, workers and trade unions) participation and involvement in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by reducing ignorance on the 2030 Agenda.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #95f900;\">STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND EXPECTED IMPACT<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]The following \u201cstrategic objectives\u201d will guide the actions of ANYL4PSD by 2030.
