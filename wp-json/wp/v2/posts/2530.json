It is in the context of how to achieve effective management of the above problems that a critical analysis of the DSCE has been made to identify the place of water restoration. It shows that water cleaning up is minimized in the DSCE. To overcome this situation, an update of DSCE by integrating the cross and inclusive sewerage becomes a necessity.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Key words:<\/strong>\u00a0Water sanitation, Strategic planning<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Resum\u00e9<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">La gestion des d\u00e9chets liquides est l\u2019un des probl\u00e8mes majeurs que souffre la ville de Yaound\u00e9.
