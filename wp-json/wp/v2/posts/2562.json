Two hydraulic loads, respectively 3 l \/ d and 5 l \/ d have been tested with each repetition. While for the lagoon system, two retention time were studied. The wastewater was collected in the different compartments of the system, kept chilled in ice and brought back to the laboratory for monitoring bacteriological and physicochemical parameters according to standard protocols.<br \/>\nThe results show that untreated sewage from the UHC (entry system) has high levelsof physical and chemical pollution (CND, MY, NO \u2083 \u02c9, NH \u2084\u207a, PO \u2084 \u00b3 \u02c9, COD and BOD5) and bacteriological (CF and SF) pollution. The purification results obtained after the implementation of a pilot plant has shown a reduction of the parameters of the above elucidated pollution rates.<br \/>\nThe untreated sewage UHC present an environmental and health risk due to high physicochemical and bacteriological pollutants concentrations. This system is efficient because of reductions achieved, but some pollution parameter to the outputs (DBO\u2085 and DCO) are greater than the discharge standards of MINEPDED. An additional treatment is required for refining treatment and ensuring environmental safety.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Keywords:<\/strong>\u00a0Wastewater, treatment system, performances, CHU.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>RESUME<\/strong><br \/>\nL\u2019objectif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de ce travail est d\u2019\u00e9valuer l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de gestion des eaux us\u00e9es du Centre Hospitalier et Universitaire (C.H.U) de Yaound\u00e9.<br \/>\nDes essais ont \u00e9t\u00e9 conduits de d\u00e9cembre 2012 \u00e0 mars 2013 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle d\u2019une station pilote construite \u00e0 l\u2019ancienne station de traitement des eaux us\u00e9es de CHU de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Yaound\u00e9 I aujourd\u2019hui \u00e0 l\u2019abandon dans le but d\u2019\u00e9tudier l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du traitement de deux syst\u00e8mes naturels de traitement des eaux us\u00e9es en s\u00e9rie constitu\u00e9 d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de filtre plant\u00e9 et de lagunage.
