Among the causes of the poor social mobilization around SDGs achievement the study noted:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Weak outreach and educational approach on the global goals that involves several sectors of the national life including rural sector, minority and vulnerable groups. a lot of people (including youth, women, and minority) know neither the signification of sustainable development goals, nor their content, nor their stakes, nor the role they can play for their achievement. The ignorance is higher in grassroots, rural, minority communities and non-intellectual people<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Insufficient frames of dialogue\/ concertation among Government, civil society, private sector, including communities leaders, young people, women and vulnerable groups;<\/p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Weak inclusive monitoring of SDGs: Statistical operations need new methodologies; stakeholders not enough equipped on reporting and monitoring.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row 0=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column css_animation=&#8221;rollIn&#8221; width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1535748236454{background-color: #95f900 !important;}&#8221;][vc_column_text 0=&#8221;&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>SDGs_REPORT OBJECTIVES<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The general objective of the SDG-Report is to create a platform for exchange between decision-makers and the populations through the mobile telephony infrastructure in general and especially SMS technology. This, in order to promote greater social mobilization around development Sustainable Development goals. This initiative is therefore deployed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">First, to encourage adolescents and young people to express themselves and to find solutions to the problems that concern them and to prepare them to become citizens committed to the development of their country, to provide useful information to adolescents and young people so that they can they share them with their communities, involve adolescents and young people in promoting the use of social services.<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then, it is also a question of amplifying the voice of adolescents and young people to foster dialogue with decision-makers and civil society and finally provide information and data on youth issues to feed programming sensitive to their needs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column css_animation=&#8221;rotateIn&#8221; width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_column_text 0=&#8221;&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #95f900;\"><strong>SDGs_REPORT TARGET<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The SDG-Report is open to anyone over the age of 12, registered on the platform and sharing their observations and reflections on the platform around the many development issues that circulate there. This is the goal of the project by building an international community of committed youth called SDGs-Reporters.&nbsp;Thanks to their commitment, the SDGs-Reporters are players for positive change. The right to participation of children and young people is an essential right, because today&#8217;s children are the citizens of tomorrow.&nbsp;It is therefore important to consult young people and involve them in decision-making.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #95f900;\"><strong>SDGs_REPORT MECHANISM<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to its dialogic scope that offers stakeholders the opportunity to interact with decision makers to solve the problems, they face daily. &nbsp;SDGs _Report includes a monitoring\/evaluation dimension of interventions. In short, SDG-Report gives people the means to contribute to development by giving their point of view through surveys or thematic consultations, but also by &#8220;evaluating&#8221; the actions taken in their favor. And in fact, it is also a platform for sharing information on priority topics and themes of national development. This tool is conceived as a response to a need to increase the participation of the populations globally and specifically young people in the life of society. It also takes into account the concern for equity in the interventions directed at the populations.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row 0=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column 0=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column_text 0=&#8221;&#8221;][\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row 0=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column 0=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column_text 0=&#8221;&#8221;]Sustainable Development Goals Report (SDGs _Report): a tool for mobilization and social dialogue for Sustainable Development Goals, backed by the SMS service.
