The fertility rate is high in several countries such as Niger (about 7.6 children per woman). Despite partner investments and Governments\u2019 efforts, several countries have a low rate of women and family controlling their births, a low rate of births attended by skilled health personnel and a low rate of children with nutritional advice. This result in significant maternal, neonatal and infant-juvenile deaths, child malnutrition and early pregnancy among young girls leading to dropping out of classes (for those attending) and endless trials between families. Many parents are unable to care for their children, who are mostly out-of-school and unemployed. Early childbirth increases the risk of dying among adolescent girls. Children of younger mothers (younger than 20) are generally more likely to die than those from older mothers. The early entry of girls into reproductive life in many country greatly reduces their opportunities, especially school and work.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To address these challenges that jeopardize the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals as they negatively impact human rights, the status of women and girls in these societies, African Network of Young Leaders for Peace and Sustainable Development undertook to dwell on these problems with a view to finding solutions to improve the conditions of social life through the application of Coaching and results oriented management. Far North Cameroon, Chad and Niger have been chosen as pilot area not only because of the migratory flow of the refugees, but also because of their cultural similarities. There are many cultural barriers which render impossible to improve girls, women, and children health.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #95f900;\"><strong>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row 0=&#8221;&#8221;][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2489&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_column_text 0=&#8221;&#8221;]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contribute to increase the number of families using family planning to control.<\/li>\n<li>Increase in the number of deliveries attended by skilled personnel.<\/li>\n<li>Increase the number of children and families receiving nutritional advice.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #95f900;\"><strong>PROGRAM COMPONENTS AND STRATEGIES<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting down multidisciplinary teams which will develop coalition to make change and results possible;<\/li>\n<li>Designing a structured process in three levels: launching, midterm review and final review during which each team is brought to fix a result to reach.<\/li>\n<li>Putting in place coaches in Districts, health centers levels to support results;<\/li>\n<li>Strengthening the capacities of individuals identified as national coaches;<\/li>\n<li>Accompanying teams and coaches with tools to reach results;<\/li>\n<li>Providing methodological support and facilitation to political and strategic leaders and teams through coaches;<\/li>\n<li>Advocacies and sensitization towards communities and governments to improve girls, women health and children nutrition by overcoming cultural barriers.<\/li>\n<li>Reporting on obstacles and difficulties encountered by teams and coaches and find out strategies to overcome them in link with the Ministry of Health officials and teams.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cameroon and many African countries have been facing gender, reproductive health and nutrition challenges for several years.
