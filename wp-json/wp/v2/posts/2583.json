If all these large trees are harvested, the forest would still be categorized as \u201cforest\u201d by the UNFCCC definition. In Cambodia and other countries where loggers often operate without management plans or supervision, the highest valued timbers are exploited first (<a class=\"link__reference js-link__reference\" title=\"Link to bibliographic citation\" href=\"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1755-263X.2009.00067.x\/full#b24\" rel=\"references:#b24\">McKinney 2002<\/a>;\u00a0<a class=\"link__reference js-link__reference\" title=\"Link to bibliographic citation\" href=\"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1755-263X.2009.00067.x\/full#b37\" rel=\"references:#b37\">So 2004<\/a>).

These changes will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from what is now termed forest \u201cdegradation\u201d without increasing monitoring costs. Furthermore, these changes will promote the switch from degradation to responsible forest management, which will help mitigate global warming while protecting biodiversity and contributing to sustainable development. We also recommend that to avoid conflicts between conservation goals, global agreements that pertain to the fates of forests include requirements for more detailed definitions of \u201cforest\u201d in national-level implementation guidelines. Given the variety of ways that forests are perceived and valued, the adopted definitions are likely to vary among countries and could include a variety of components, but explicit and appropriate definitions are nonetheless of paramount importance at the country level. At least in regard to standing stocks of forest carbon, recent advances in remote sensing technology that allow cost-effective monitoring of forest degradation coupled with the substantial and increasing emissions from poor logging and forest fires, continued disregard of the second \u201cD\u201d in REDD is not justified. Including forest degradation in the new climate change agreements will help ensure the sustainability of ecosystem services and protect the livelihoods of forest-dependent people while providing a low-cost option for reducing carbon emissions.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text] ABSTRACT If global policies intended to promote forest conservation continue to use the definition of \u201cforest\u201d adopted in 2001 by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (an area of &gt;0.05\u20131 ha with &gt;10\u201330% cover of plants &gt;2\u20135 m tall at maturity), great quantities of carbon and other environmental values will be lost when natural forests are severely degraded or replaced by plantations but technically remain \u201cforests.\u201d While a definition of \u201cforest\u201d that [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2110,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_bbp_topic_count":0,"_bbp_reply_count":0,"_bbp_total_topic_count":0,"_bbp_total_reply_count":0,"_bbp_voice_count":0,"_bbp_anonymous_reply_count":0,"_bbp_topic_count_hidden":0,"_bbp_reply_count_hidden":0,"_bbp_forum_subforum_count":0},"categories":[61],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.11 -
