The methodology used consisted of a documentary review on similar works of the same theme. Thereafter, investigations and questionaires which were related to the organization and the management of QHSE aspects were inflicted to the personnel according to the regulation in force. To facilitate understandings, weekly site visits were carried out for better observing the medium, detecting the risks related to each activity and the means set up to reduce \/ eliminate them. The results categorized according to the Ishikawa diagram show that; investigations carried out from the checklist, one counts seven (07) non conformities as regards the method and the medium. In the same way, three (03) non conformities result from the one and labour (01) of the matter. Thereafter, questionaires realized from 105 employees, show that 60 % of the workers had a good level of knowledge of QHSE aspects, 53 % of them have a good level of comprehension of this subject and 79 % of the personnel communicate better in the company. According to the activities carried out in the various work units, we numbered forty (40) risks with the weak accidents, twenty-three (23) of them had serious accidents and eighteen (18) had serious and critical accidents. To reduce\/eliminate these risks, an action plan was establishes in order to allow a better integration of QHSE aspects. The application of the regulatory requirements in force, reinforce the capacities of the personnel on risks related to quality, hygiene, safety and environment and instauration of synergy between the personnel and the local populations on intervention strategies event of emergency which will be a better strategy to integrate QHSE aspects into the SONARA.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Key words:<\/strong>\u00a0Quality-Hygiene-Safety-Environment, Risk, Management, Strategy, SONARA.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>RESUME<\/strong><br \/>\nL\u2019\u00e9tude men\u00e9e \u00e0 la SONARA (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Raffinage) durant la p\u00e9riode de Juillet 2015 \u00e0 Octobre 2015 avait pour objectif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u2019\u00e9valuer le niveau de prise en compte des aspects Qualit\u00e9, Hygi\u00e8ne, S\u00e9curit\u00e9 et Environnement (QHSE) au sein de la SONARA. Dans cette optique la m\u00e9thodologie utilis\u00e9e a consist\u00e9 \u00e0 une revue documentaire sur l\u2019ensemble des travaux ayant trait audit sujet. Par la suite, des enqu\u00eates et des entretiens directs portant sur l\u2019organisation et la gestion des aspects QHSE, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 administr\u00e9s au personnel en fonction de la r\u00e8glementation en vigueur. Pour faciliter la compr\u00e9hension, des descentes hebdomadaires sur le site ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es pour mieux observer le milieu, d\u00e9celer les risques li\u00e9s \u00e0 chaque activit\u00e9 et les moyens mis en place pour les r\u00e9duire \/ \u00e9liminer. Les r\u00e9sultats cat\u00e9goris\u00e9s \u00e0 partir du diagramme d\u2019Ishikawa suite aux enqu\u00eates effectu\u00e9es \u00e0 base de la check-list ressortent sept (07) non conformit\u00e9s pour ce qui est de la m\u00e9thode et du milieu. De m\u00eame, trois (03) non conformit\u00e9s sont issus de la main d\u2019oeuvre et une (01) de la mati\u00e8re. Ensuite, les entretiens r\u00e9alis\u00e9s aupr\u00e8s de 105 employ\u00e9s, d\u00e9montrent que 60 % des travailleurs ont une bonne connaissance des aspects QHSE, 53 % d\u2019entre eux ont un bon niveau de compr\u00e9hension \u00e0 ce sujet et 79 % du personnel communique mieux en entreprise. Cependant, sur cinquante-neuf (59) activit\u00e9s identifi\u00e9es \u00e0 la SONARA, on d\u00e9nombre quatre-vingt-deux (82) risques auxquels font face le personnel. Les risques ayant des accidents faibles sont comptabilis\u00e9s au nombre de quarante (40), ceux aux accidents potentiellement graves sont au nombre de vingt-trois (23) et les risques ayant des accidents graves et critiques sont au nombre de dix-huit (18). Pour r\u00e9duire\/\u00e9liminer ces risques un plan d\u2019action a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablit afin de permettre une meilleure int\u00e9gration des aspects QHSE.
