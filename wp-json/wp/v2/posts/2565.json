The general objective of the survey is to contribute in improving onthe lives of the village population in order to improve on their involvement in the conservation of natural resources of their milieu.<br \/>\nThus, inspired by the tools borrowed on the active method of the participative research, this work consisted of carrying out an investigation by 570 people coming from 04 villages, in which the data had been gotten manually in order to identify the assembly of variable answers..<br \/>\nThe results obtained revealed that the quasi-totality of the population is agriculturallybased by 90%.In the same way, these results permitted us to understand that the pressure exerted on natural resources is a function of the villages, the sex, age and the size of the population. It is higher in Ancient Zoulabot and lesser in Ancient Song. The damages linked to the conservation of biodiversity is in four orders: agriculture (60%), fishing (10%), poaching (20%) and picking (10%). The protection of the Boumba-Bek and Nkinational Park brings about subsistence difficulties for the Baka pygmies and the Kounabemb\u00e9s Bantus whose elementary and social needs don\u2019t seem to be taken in account in territorial development projects.<br \/>\nFrom then on, it became imperative to know the local means of natural resources management.. Hence ,two major types of methods have been mentioned which are the active and passive methods. To these one can add the willingness of the populations to be educated on the necessity of biodiversity conservation in general and natural resources in particular.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Key words:<\/strong>\u00a0Biodiversity, Conservation, Natural Resources, National Parks.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>RESUME<\/strong><br \/>\nLa pr\u00e9sente \u00e9tude a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e du 30 Mai au 26 Juin 2006 dans les r\u00e9gions du Sud-Est Cameroun, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment dans les villages Song ancien, Mal\u00e9a ancien, Zoulabot ancien et Ngatto ancien, riverains aux parcs nationaux de Boumba Bek et de Nki. L\u2019objectif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019\u00e9tude est de contribuer \u00e0 l\u2019am\u00e9lioration de vie des populations des villages en vue d\u2019am\u00e9liorer leur participation \u00e0 la conservation des ressources naturelles de leur milieu.<br \/>\nAinsi, en s\u2019inspirant des outils emprunt\u00e9s \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode active de la recherche participative, le travail a consist\u00e9 \u00e0 effectuer une enqu\u00eate aupr\u00e8s de 570 personnes provenant de 04 villages, au terme de laquelle les donn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pouill\u00e9es manuellement afin d\u2019identifier l\u2019ensemble des variables de r\u00e9ponse.<br \/>\nLes r\u00e9sultats obtenus ont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 entre autre que la quasi-totalit\u00e9 de la population est agricole soit 90%. De m\u00eame, ces r\u00e9sultats ont permis de comprendre que la pression exerc\u00e9e sur les ressources naturelles est fonction des villages, du sexe, de l\u2019\u00e2ge et de la taille de la population. Elle est accrue \u00e0 Zoulabot ancien et l\u2019est beaucoup moins \u00e0 Song ancien. Les d\u00e9g\u00e2ts li\u00e9s \u00e0 la conservation de la biodiversit\u00e9 se veulent de quatre ordres : l\u2019agriculture (60%), la p\u00eache (10%), la chasse (20%) et la cueillette (10%). La protection des Parcs nationaux de Boumba-Bek et de Nki entraine des difficult\u00e9s de subsistance pour les Pygm\u00e9es Baka et les Bantou Kounabemb\u00e9 dont les besoins sociaux \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires ne semblent pas \u00eatre pris en compte dans les projets de d\u00e9veloppement territoriaux.<br \/>\nD\u00e8s lors, il est devenu imp\u00e9ratif de savoir quels sont les moyens locaux de gestion des ressources naturelles. Ainsi il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 deux types majeurs dont les m\u00e9thodes dites actives et celles dites passives.
