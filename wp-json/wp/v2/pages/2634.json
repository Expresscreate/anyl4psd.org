The region houses the reserve of Dja which is the best protected humid forest (526 000 ha) situated in Congo Bassin and the largest reservoir of biological diversity of the world.\u00a0 The relief in many localities as the locality of Somalomo is very little accident. It is characterized by low hills, draining huge amounts of runoff in the rainy season, resulting in the formation of streams in the valleys.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The degradation of the environment is much accentuated. In some localities, the extensive degradation is manifested by erosion in the form of \"lavaka\", which has negative impacts on lands cultivation by annual silting. These major erosions have a negative impact on agricultural production, while deforestation is leading to an increasingly pronounced rainfall delay each year.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The exploitation of natural resources in the Dja Faunal Reserve is carried out by the local populations, who mainly harvest non-timber forest products and fish along the rivers both inside and on the periphery of the Reserve. The Dja is at the center of several major projects including the construction of a hydro-electric dam in the south-western periphery in Mekin, an agro-industrial plantation and the G\u00e9ovic mining project in the northern periphery.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is a mismanagement of natural resource that has been one of the major causes of the severe land degradation, namely the influence of the various activities (deforestation and poaching) of indigenous people impacting the Dja reserve soil and biosphere.

2) Use of fire for land clearance and pest control in pastures, resulting in removal of the vegetative protection of the soil against raindrop impact and cross-surface flow, and loss of soil carbon and nitrogen; 3) Inappropriate use of irrigation, including the use of practices with low water efficiency and high drop impact (such as aspersion, instead of drip irrigation and conservation of natural soil water through mulching), poor design of irrigation systems and drainage in relation to natural topography, the location of irrigated agriculture in zones with limited aquifer resources, and the use of poor quality (saline) water, resulting in salinization and erosion of soils, and the depletion of scarce aquifer resources; 4) Inappropriate crop selection, related to soil productive potential, relief, water and nutrient availability and climatic patterns, resulting in degradation of soil nutrient status, increased pressure on scarce water resources and increased soil erosion on steep slopes due to the inadequacy of soil cover; 5) Poor livestock management, including the free range grazing of animals and the use of excessive stocking levels, resulting in degradation of vegetation resources and the compaction of soils, reducing rates of aquifer recharge through infiltration and increasing cross-surface runoff which causes erosion. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">After having interviewed communities and agricultural stakeholders, it appeared that there is an inadequate awareness among producers of implications of effects of agriculture on steep slopes and on possible alternatives. Producers are limited aware of i) technical aspects of alternative irrigation and water management methods of crop alternatives in relation to site characteristics, and ii) implications of poor crop selection, iii) alternatives to extensive ranching (such as pasture improvement, stabling, cut-and-carry and fodder banks).&nbsp; <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Actions of producers are not adequately controlled or directed. There is limited access to human, physical and financial resources needed for land preparation through alternative means.&nbsp; There is not an effective regulation of i) burning and ii) livestock raising practices<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">These threats that are of particular significance include pressures affecting forest and bush through conversion to pasture, followed by subsequent degradation by soil erosion, particularly on slopes, poor pasture management and fire. Water management issues are of particular concern; other factors to be address include the excessive use of monocultures and the use of crops and livestock which are inappropriate for local conditions (include slopes of more than 15%, not recommended for livestock), high levels for salinity, and poor water quality, which is not suitable for irrigation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><u><span lang=\"EN-US\">Project objective<\/span><\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The project objective was to reduce land degradation and enable producers to have access and making use of financial mechanisms in support of sustainable land management SLM in a sustainable manner that contributes to maintaining ecosystem productivity and functions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><u><span lang=\"EN-US\">Target areas<\/span><\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">The project was implemented in three subdivisions:<\/span><\/p>\n<table class=\"Grilledutableau1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

This invasive aquatic plant is posing serious ecologic and social problems in the estuary like destruction of local biodiversity, accelerating sedimentation of sand, blocking water surface preventing navigation and asphyxia of marine life in extreme cases. . Reports show that two decades back the invasive aquatic weed was not a problem. However in recent years its population has multiplied and moved from the creeks to inland water bodies in the estuary. The Douala city host 80% of industries in Cameroon and a population of 3,000,000 with a population density of 350 persons per square kilometer. The city harbors the Wouri River which empties into the Atlantic Ocean and constitute a principal wetland. This is attributed to degraded petroleum products from local industries rejected into the estuarial waters is the main cause of environmental hazards in the estuary and dumping most of its waste into the coastal rivers and a major threat to the local biodiversity. Studies show the Wouri estuary has 112,225 Hectares of the invasive water hyacinth plant within a distance of 209Km (Watershed Task Group (WTG) report 2009). The plant is made up of roots, rhizome, petiole and leaves is considered one of the world&rsquo;s worst weeds as it can double its population in 18 days invading lakes, ponds, canals and rivers and negatively affected the living conditions of indigenous people (Bassa, Bakoko, Pongos, Grassfield) and migrants (Nigerians, Ghanaians, Beninois and Malians) whose major socio-economic activities are fishing, farming, logging, canoe manufacturing and sand digging.

In principle, these slaughterhouses (meat preparation plants) are located along watercourses to facilitate the supply of water necessary for the treatment of carcasses (meat) and viscera or abas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In the North Cameroon region, there are several slaughterhouses of modern, traditional and semi-traditional type. Slaughterhouses, whether traditional (bush), modern or industrial, as well as most slaughter areas, because of their location near watercourses, discharge fecal matter, blood, and water into the water. other inedible parts. These wastes inevitably pollute water and impact the earth and make it unfit for domestic use and even for watering animals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In general, the equipment at the slaughterhouse level is reduced because investments have become almost non-existent. The dilapidated nature of this equipment favors the rejection of the majority of the waste in the waters with all the resulting consequences of pollution. Lack of education for some workers and neglect of other slaughterhouse staff forces them to throw carcasses and organs. These often cause diseases such as tuberculosis in streams while meat or carcasses should be destroyed by the appropriate methods.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The disposal of slaughterhouse waste in rivers is a significant source of water pollution. Not only heavy solid loads that are poured daily in rivers impede the flow of water, but also faces carry pathogens (parasites of blood, digestive tract, bacteria) that infect the water and make it unsuitable, otherwise dangerous for humans and cattle that consume it or just for the use of household and agricultural work (watering gardens for example).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The lack of proper logistics, lack of training of technical staff and support staff of these slaughterhouses contributes to water and land pollution. However, feces recovered and dried can for example be used as manure to enrich the cultivable soils to increase agricultural production. Similarly, dried blood, calcined and powdered bones can be used in the feeding of poultry and pigs. The infrastructures present in the slaughterhouses do not make it possible to make profitable this waste. They are simply thrown into the water without fear of the consequences that may occur.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><u><span lang=\"EN-US\">Objective<\/span><\/u><\/strong><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">:<\/span><\/strong><span lang=\"EN-US\"> To reduce land degradation and water pollution through capacity building of community leaders and staff of Garoua and Pitoa slaughterhouses in animal waste treatment techniques.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><u><span lang=\"EN-US\">Results<\/span><\/u><\/strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">:<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin-left: 36.0pt;

Land is also a significant component of business assets, which play significant role in business investment strategies. Thus, securing land rights can have a profound impact on economic development. Land in rural areas is both a means of agricultural production, livestock rearing and a place for gathering natural products that play an important role in local economies such as woodcutting, wild harvesting, grazing, fishing, hunting, etc. Furthermore, land is a source of identity and cultural heritage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Land is an important source of security against poverty across the continent and developing world, unequal rights to land put women at a disadvantage, perpetuate poverty, and entrench gender inequality in Africa. Gender has become a critical issue in women&rsquo;s land rights due to the fact that there is direct relationship between accessing land resources, having secured land rights, achieving food security and overcoming poverty. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In Niger, country that is affected by Desertification Land degradation and Drought, women are estimated to produce up to 60&ndash;80 per cent of the food.

These States realized in 1995 that the provisions of the Convention relating to the emission reductions were insufficient. Since then, the Parties to the Protocol have continued negotiations and have amended it to achieve more ambitious results by 2030. In the last two years, ( 2015 and 2016) two COPs were organized respectively in Paris and Marrakech. During these two recent conferences of about two weeks each, businesses, investors, cities and local governments, NGOs, the private sector, consultants, and the Working Group of United Nations on Gender, Youth and Civil Society have made new commitments to climate change, in addition to the thousands already formulated in previous years. From the beginning, young people have actively participated in the Conferences of the Parties (COPs) organized by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) In 2009, during the COP15, the UNFCCC secretariat and the UNCCD Member States have formally recognized the youth as observers' constituency (confirming status in 2011) to represent the formal voice youth in the UNFCCC processes. As result, Conference of Youth (COY) has been instituted. The main goal of COY is to organize a space for training and capacity building for young activists participating in the COP. During the COY, many workshops and discussions focus on youth empowerment and scientific provision and political knowledge actions to take. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Women and youth constitute the most important part of our countries populations and present theirselve as vulnerable people.

Its geographical location explains the variety of its landscapes, its climate, its fauna and its population. Covering an area of 475,000 km2, the population of Cameroon is estimated at about 23 million inhabitants with a population growth of 3692%, leading to an overpopulation of the capital Yaound&eacute;. This city counts in January 2017 more than 3 million inhabitants for about 1,750,000 households, against 2,300,000 inhabitants for 1,500,000 households in 2014. This increase of the population is accompanied by an increase of wild dumps, gullies, pavements and streams, creating a different facies to the city. Such as air burning, wild burial; the filling of the ditches, used by the inhabitants to evacuate these wastes can be harmful and have direct impacts on the hygiene and the living environment. The only company in charge of waste is HYSACAM ( Hygi&egrave;ne et Sallubrit&eacute; du Cameroun\/ Hygiene and health of Cameroon) . This way of managing waste appears like a waste, and does not meet any standard of sustainable development. In fact, the quantity of waste produced in the 7 communes of Yaound&eacute; amounts to more than 658,000 tons of waste in 2015.

It is characterized by low hills, draining huge amounts of runoff in the rainy season, resulting in the formation of streams in the valleys.\r\nThe degradation of the environment is much accentuated. In some localities, the extensive degradation is manifested by erosion in the form of &quot;lavaka&quot;, which has negative impacts on lands cultivation by annual silting. These major erosions have a negative impact on agricultural production, while deforestation is leading to an increasingly pronounced rainfall delay each year.\r\nThe exploitation of natural resources in the Dja Faunal Reserve is carried out by the local populations, who mainly harvest non-timber forest products and fish along the rivers both inside and on the periphery of the Reserve. The Dja is at the center of several major projects including the construction of a hydro-electric dam in the south-western periphery in Mekin, an agro-industrial plantation and the G\u00e9ovic mining project in the northern periphery.\r\nThere is a mismanagement of natural resource that has been one of the major causes of the severe land degradation, namely the influence of the various activities (deforestation and poaching) of indigenous people impacting the Dja reserve soil and biosphere.

These wastes inevitably pollute water and impact the earth and make it unfit for domestic use and even for watering animals.\r\nIn general, the equipment at the slaughterhouse level is reduced because investments have become almost non-existent. The dilapidated nature of this equipment favors the rejection of the majority of the waste in the waters with all the resulting consequences of pollution. Lack of education for some workers and neglect of other slaughterhouse staff forces them to throw carcasses and organs. These often cause diseases such as tuberculosis in streams while meat or carcasses should be destroyed by the appropriate methods.\r\nThe disposal of slaughterhouse waste in rivers is a significant source of water pollution. Not only heavy solid loads that are poured daily in rivers impede the flow of water, but also faces carry pathogens (parasites of blood, digestive tract, bacteria) that infect the water and make it unsuitable, otherwise dangerous for humans and cattle that consume it or just for the use of household and agricultural work (watering gardens for example).\r\nThe lack of proper logistics, lack of training of technical staff and support staff of these slaughterhouses contributes to water and land pollution.
