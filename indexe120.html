DESCRIPTION:Background\nThe Youth Environment Assembly is the official youth forum towards the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA).  The Youth Environment Assembly, marks the starting point of this year and try to outline a post-pandemic way forward for ambitious environmental governance.  As this year 2021 marks the year of COVID-recovery and #building back better, the forum will take place online   12, 13 and 18, 19, 20 February 2021, through a conference run by youth and for the youth! The constituency values meaningful stakeholder engagement and strives to continue improving its stakeholder engagement processes. Several partners events will be organized with the aim to enable youth-led organisations, UN entities, multilateral organisations, and other groups from different sectors to be able to mobilize the youth community to engage in the YEA!\nContext and objective\nAs part of this Forum African Network of Young Leaders for Peace and Sustainable Development (ANYL4PSD) in partnership with the [A]political Pipeline and Climate Social Forum is organizing a side-event on the topic: Sustainability and Human Rights: Looking beyond Environmental and Climate Change Law!\nThe aim of this event is to engage with negotiators, ministers, UN entities and stakeholders. Through capacity building, networking, advocacy campaigns, political debates and opinion forming activities children and children and youth work on strengthening youth engagement and strengthening environmental protection.\n \nWe are increasingly noticing the drawbacks of environmental and climate change law when it comes to protecting the environment.  Hence, the organizations have researched and developed a free Massive Online Open Course for people highlighting how commercial and economic law contribute to sustainability and help prevent climate change.\n \nIn the end, we would have a youth roundtable discussing if this is the right approach to go about it, releasing a position paper. You would have it all from discussions on environmental law to corporations to youth participation!\n \n————————————-\nRegister here for our upcoming MOOC on Sustainability and Commercial Law:\nhttps://forms.gle/M2eKn1L2iLXEdi4SA\n \n \n \n
